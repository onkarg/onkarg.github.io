    <h2 class="section_title">About Me</h2>
    <section class="about">
      <div class="about__details">
        <p>Growing up I was endlessly intrigued by how everything around me worked. Even as a young child, if I saw something
          broken I felt driven to identify the problem and try to figure out a solution. The passion I've developed for programming
          has unfolded in my adult life in a similar way.</p>
        <p>Recently I transitioned my career from being an Assistant Manager of a help desk team in Boston to following my dream
          of becoming a software engineer, learning to be able to have an idea and turn that idea into something tangible
          using React, Redux, HTML, CSS. After arriving in Phoenix I attended a bootcamp called DevMountain, which taught
          me the fundamentals of what it takes to become a software engineer, building projects on my own and with a team.
          I learned the importance of collaboration, teamwork to get more done, learning from others and sharing with others
          what I know.
        </p>
        <p>Going through these projects has taught me to become a team player; has helped me to manage multiple tasks effectively
          and shown me the importance of version control. The passion I have developed for programming has driven me to tackle
          every problem with full force and to find its solution.</p>
